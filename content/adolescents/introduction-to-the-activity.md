<form method="post" action="."><h3>Background</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>You are a North Oralington licensed general dentist working in a private suburban practice when you are approached by Duane County's St. Cabrini Adolescent Health Center (AHC). They are seeking your assistance in expanding their health services to include an oral health program to serve the underserved poor/low income adolescents in the local neighborhood. Even though you donâ€™t have extensive experience working with young adults, you agree to help.</p>
</div><h3>Your charge</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>After estimating that you can set aside half a day each week from your primary practice, you agree to serve as a part-time dental consultant. You have been given the responsibility of choosing a physical site location for the dental program and advising on the overall operation and design.</p>
<p>The St. Cabrini board of directors would like to come present your recommendations and answer any questions regarding the program design. You are scheduled to present at their next board meeting in <strong>4 days.</strong></p>
</div><h3>How to begin</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>Use the interactive map on the next page to learn more about the local area by turning on and off the layers.</p>
<p>Over the next four days, you also have the opportunity to interview a number of community stakeholders who may provide you with insight on how to design your dental program. Keep in mind the information regarding adolescents presented earlier in this module as well as the five characteristics that WHO recommends for responsive adolescent health services.</p>
<p>As in real life, there is a limit to the time and effort that you can devote to this project. You will not be able to meet with every stakeholder or have time to ask every question that you would like. It is therefore essential for you to be strategic and thoughtful regarding which stakeholders you choose to meet with and what questions you choose to ask.</p>
</div><h3>Notepad</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>You will have a notepad available at all times to keep notes and organize your strategy before presenting to the board.</p>
<p><strong>Please take advantage of this tool as it will be your only source of reference material on the day of your presentation.</strong></p>
</div><h3>Conclusion</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>At the end of the 4th day, you will attend the board meeting and be expected to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recommend a site location</li>
<li>Describe how you believe the program should be designed</li>
<li>Answer questions from the St. Cabrini board of directors</li>
</ol>
