<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>See how your responses match up with our suggested considerations for adolescents. Take a moment to reflect on any aspects of your proposed program you may have overlooked. Note that some responses may overlap into more than one area.</p>
<p>Please remember that while guidelines and recommendations for providing health services to adolescent populations exist, there is often no single correct "answer" or approach.</p>
