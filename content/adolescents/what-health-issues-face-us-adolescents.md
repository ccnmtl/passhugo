<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>While most adolescents are considered healthy by traditional medical measures, many engage in risky behaviors, have unhealthy habits, and experience physical and psychosocial health conditions. These may have adverse effects on their immediate and future overall health, including oral health. Dental caries experience increases with age as teens become more independent in their own dietary, oral hygiene, and other health practices. Risk factors associated with dental caries in the adolescent population include poor eating patterns and food choices, as well as inadequate personal oral hygiene. Oral disease often progresses as these behaviors continue into adulthood. Widespread fluoridation has delayed caries progression, causing many young adults experience the levels of tooth decay that, in past decades, had occurred earlier in life (particularly interproximal caries).</p>
<p>Other health concerns in this population are:</p>
</div><h3>Unintentional and intentional Injury</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>Many behaviors increase risk for injury, including using alcohol and street drugs, driving without a seat belt, cycling without a helmet, oral piercings, and engaging in contact sports without mouth guards. Self-inflicted injuries, such as biting, are most common in teenage years and are often regarded as inappropriate coping mechanisms in dealing with strong emotions, social pressures, or relationship problems. Motor vehicle crashes, homicide, and suicide are the leading causes of mortality among adolescents.</p>
</div><h3>Chronic diseases like obesity, asthma, and diabetes</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>The number of overweight adolescents has more than tripled since 1980. Currently, more than 17% of children ages 12 - 19 are overweight. The prevalence of asthma and diabetes among teens is also continuing to increase.</p>
</div><h3>Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>STD's are the most common infectious diseases in adolescents. They range from mild and curable, such as Chlamydia, to severe and controllable, such as HIV. Young people ages 15 - 24 are responsible for almost half of the 19 million new STD infections each year.</p>
</div><h3>Mental Illnesses</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>Mental illnesses affect 10 - 20% of young adults. Anxiety is the most common mental health disorder in adolescents. Half of all adult lifetime mental disorders start by age 14. </p>
