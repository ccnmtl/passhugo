<p>No longer children, and not yet adults, adolescents fall through the cracks in many ways. Rapid developmental changes and risky behaviors leave them inherently vulnerable and susceptible. As a group, they are also underserved by dentists. Compared to children ages 6-7, adolescents ages 16-17 are 10% less likely to obtain preventive dental care <em>(<a href="http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_files/publications/cb17/cb17.pdf" target="_blank">MEPS 2007</a>)</em>.</p>
<p>Dental students, like yourselves, may not regard adolescents as a vulnerable population. New graduates often possess little "how to" knowledge about effectively shaping their careers in ways that meet the needs of the underserved, especially adolescents.</p>
