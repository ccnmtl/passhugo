title: "About Population Based Approaches to Patient Service and Professional Success (PASS)"
---

While dental education intensely prepares future dentists for understanding and applying biomedical and chemical competencies, there is little opportunity to consider the patient populations they will be able to serve at the completion of their training.

[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine](http://dental.columbia.edu) and [Columbia Center for Teaching and Learning](http://ctl.columbia.edu) have developed PASS learning modules with support from the Health Resources and Services Administration Title VII Training Grant D85HP20031 “Training dental students for community-based primary care across the lifespan,” which aimed to imbue dental students with an understanding of community health and how to incorporate substantial ongoing primary care for the underserved into their careers.
