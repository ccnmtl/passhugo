<div class="pageblock"><p>Throughout this activity you will be exposed to the health and wellness concerns the older adult population faces as they age. You will start out the activity as a fourth year dental student at  North Oralington University College of Dentistry. You have an aging aunt and uncle that live in the same city as you and your parents have asked that you periodically check in on them.  As both a family member and dental professional advancing in your career you will be asked to guide your aunt and uncle through a series of issues for this population.</p>
