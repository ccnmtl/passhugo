Nonetheless, older adults face numerous challenges in receiving both preventive and treatment services. While access to oral health care may be less of a hurdle among institutionalized seniors, cognitive and medical declines, coupled with an oral health care workforce untrained to deal with these complex needs constitute major barriers to receipt of oral care services. Among community dwelling older adults, public payor systems, transportation difficulties, and inability to navigate the healthcare system may complicate both professional and personal oral care. The increasing diversity of US seniors further confounds the picture, as health-related practices are informed by culture and social norms in older adult and their caregivers.</p>
