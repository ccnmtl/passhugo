<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>Here you will learn about the low functioning older adult population and adults who need home care. You will also learn about home care services for homebound adults and oral health services provided by each. </p>
<p>A couple years have passed and you are now an associate at a private dental practice. Your uncle’s health has declined and he has become dependent on others’ care and attention for most of the day. Your aunt tries to do the best she can, but her arthritis gets worse and she has difficulty cooking and moving around. She also cannot drive and used to rely on her husband for transportation, but now due to his illness he can not drive. The last time that you spoke with her, she was complaining about his ill fitting partial denture and inability to address it because they now have difficulty getting to the dental clinic. You visit them at home and while in their kitchen you notice a few areas of concern.</p>
