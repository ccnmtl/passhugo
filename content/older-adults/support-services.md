<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>The case manager visits with your Aunt and Uncle and says she will be in touch shortly with recommendations for services. She provides a list of choices she will be reviewing within each service area. The case manager says it will take a couple of weeks for them to then start.  Click on each service to see what it provides.  You must click on each one before moving forward. </p>
