<div class="pageblock"><p><b>Glucose control:</b> It is important for your Aunt to monitor her blood glucose as suggested by her doctor and to try to maintain normal blood glucose control.  Not only are people with diabetes more susceptible to serious gum disease, but serious gum disease may have the potential to affect blood glucose control and contribute to the progression of diabetes. Research suggests that people with diabetes are at higher risk for oral health problems, such as gingivitis (an early stage of gum disease) and periodontitis (serious gum disease). People with diabetes are at an increased risk for serious gum disease because they are generally more susceptible to bacterial infection, and have a decreased ability to fight bacteria that invade the gums.</p>
<p><b>Oral hygiene:</b> You Aunt may be having difficulty with maintaining oral hygiene because of her arthritis.  Seniors who have trouble with manual dexterity from arthritis or another condition can use floss holders or interproximal (between-the-teeth) cleaners, which are available at most drugstores and supermarkets. Toothbrush handles may be modified by wrapping a washcloth around the handle and securing it with an elastic band. This will make the handle thicker and easier to hold. Some companies also sell thicker-handled toothbrushes.</p>
<p><b>Xerostomia:</b> Your Aunt may be experiencing dry mouth from medications that she is taking. Sugar free gum, sugar free candy and drinking water are recommended to help combat dry mouth.  You can also recommend the use of commercially available saliva substitutes, which can moisten the mouth.  Also, ensure adequate fluoride through the use of toothpastes, rinses or gels.</p>
