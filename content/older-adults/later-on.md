<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>As an up and coming dental professional you know that oral health can offer clues about your overall health — or that problems in your mouth can affect the rest of your body. When your aunt mentions that she has noticed some bleeding on brushing which she has not previously experienced you recommend that she set up an appointment at your dental school clinic and you assist in making arrangements to have her visit. </p>
<p>Her clinical exam reveals: <br/>
amalgam #2, 3-unit bridge #13, 14, 15, crown number #29</p>
<p>You also find that she has generalized inflammation and deep pockets at tooth numbers 2, 5, 17, 18. She has quite heavy calculus build-up around the lower anterior teeth and incipient caries on the occlusal surfaces of 3, 18, 30 and root caries on 6 and 8. </p>
