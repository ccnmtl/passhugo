<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>As an up and coming dental professional you know that oral health can offer clues about your overall health — or that problems in your mouth can affect the rest of your body. When your aunt mentions that she has noticed some bleeding on brushing which she has not previously experienced you recommend that she set up an appointment at your dental school clinic and you assist in making arrangements to have her visit. </p>
<p>Her clinical exam reveals: <br/>
amalgam #2, 3-unit bridge #13, 14, 15, crown number #29</p>
<p>You also find that she has generalized inflammation and deep pockets at tooth numbers 2, 5, 17, 18. She has quite heavy calculus build-up around the lower anterior teeth and incipient caries on the occlusal surfaces of 3, 18, 30 and root caries on 6 and 8. </p>

            </label><div class="selection-block hidden"><h3>Diabetes (e.g. glucose monitor)</h3>
                People with diabetes are at higher risk for periodontal disease. Poor blood glucose control makes periodontal disease more likely and more severe. Poorly managed periodontal disease increases the risk for elevated blood glucose.  Diabetes may also result in dry mouth, increasing the risk for dental and root caries.
            </div><label class="selection"><input name="question149" type="radio" value="issue_2"/>Arthritis
            </label><div class="selection-block hidden"><h3>Arthritis</h3>
                Arthritis can lead to joint pain in the hands, making it difficult for patients to hold a toothbrush or denture brush. Patients may need a modified tooth-brush or assistance with daily toothbrushing or denture care.
            </div><label class="selection"><input name="question149" type="radio" value="issue_3"/>Depression (meds)
            </label><div class="selection-block hidden"><h3>Depression (meds)</h3>
                About 25% of adults aged 65 years or older have some type of mental health problem, such as a mood disorder not associated with normal aging. Often self-care, including tooth brushing declines with depression.  Many medications for depression may lead to dry mouth increasing risk for dental caries.
            </div><label class="selection"><input name="question149" type="radio" value="issue_4"/>Xerostomia (meds)
            </label><div class="selection-block hidden"><h3>Xerostomia (meds)</h3>
                Xerostomia (dry mouth) increases the risk for dental caries.  Many older people who suffer from dry mouth also like to suck on sugary hard candies.  This in turn results in an increased risk for dental caries.
            </div><label class="selection"><input name="question149" type="radio" value="issue_5"/>Osteoporosis
            </label><div class="selection-block hidden"><h3>Osteoporosis</h3>
                Dentists may be able to detect the first signs of osteoporosis.  Gum disease contributes to bone loss and may provide a clue to the diagnosis of an underlying disease such as osteoporosis.

            </label><div class="selection-block hidden"><h3>Cancer</h3>
                Head and neck radiation, chemotherapy, and blood and marrow transplantation can cause oral complications ranging from dry mouth to life-threatening infections.
