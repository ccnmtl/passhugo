<ul>
<li>Significant health disparities and barriers to health care exist when compared with people who do not have disabilities.</li>
<li>Lack of  health insurance or coverage for necessary services, such as specialty care, long-term services, prescription medications, durable medical equipment, and assistive technologies is prevalent</li>
<li>Most federally funded health disparities research does not include people with disabilities as a disparity population</li>
<li>Lack of professional training on disability core competencies for health care practitioners prevents people with disabilities from accessing effective care</li>
<li>Lack awareness about steps necessary to ensure that patients with disabilities have access to culturally competent care</li>
<li>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has limited impact on how health care is delivered for people with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>A NCD progress report published 5 years later in October 2014 highlighted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employment is a key step in maintaining economic self-sufficiency</li>
<li>People with a disability are employed at a lower rate 33.5% as compared to 76.3% of non-disabled persons</li>
<li>Factors such as transportation, workplace culture, and technology impact employment experiences and opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been reported by Mahmoudi and Meade in 2014 that individuals with physical disabilities have 75% higher odds of having unmet medical needs, 57% higher odds of unmet dental needs, and 85% higher odds of having prescription medication needs unmet. Study conclusions concur with the NCD that having a physical disability, living at or near the poverty level, and lacking health insurance increase the odds of unmet health care needs.</p>
<p>According to the CDC when comparing the health status among people with disabilities to people without disabilities in all states the following were noted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persons with disabilities were more likely to report needing to see a doctor but could not because the costs were prohibitive</li>
<li>Obesity rates by disability status are higher among persons with disabilities</li>
<li>Cigarette smoking by status is higher than among disabled persons</li>
<li>Mammography rates among women with disabilities is lower</li>
<li>Physical inactivity is prevalent among adults with a disability</li>
</ul>
<p>These findings suggest a disparity in access to effective health promotion strategies and prevention programs for persons with a disability.</p>
