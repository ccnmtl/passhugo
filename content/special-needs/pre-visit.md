<div class="pageblock"><p>After your conversation with Donna your office staff arrange a pre-visit for Tyler.</p>
<p>Tyler presents with his mother at 11:00 AM to the dental office. All of the staff was made aware of his appointment. The front desk staff greeted him and Donna cheerfully. The television in the waiting area was programmed to show a cake decorating video. When Tyler arrives he cautiously checks out the area and sits in a waiting room chair fixated on the television screen. Dr. Smith and you come into the waiting area and greet Donna and Tyler. Since Tyler knows his aunt he allows her to walk him back into the dental operatory area. However, once Tyler sees the dental chair he lets go of his aunt’s hand and walks straight back into the waiting area and sits in his chair to watch TV and refuses to budge. </p>
<p>You brought your iPad with a cooking video playing and showed it to Tyler. You led him into the operatory but he refused to sit in the dental chair. You allowed him to hold the iPad while you asked him to sit in a stationary chair in the dental treatment room. </p>
<p>While he was watching the iPad you showed Tyler your mirror and explained that you wanted to check his teeth. Tyler would not allow you to look in his mouth however he held the mirror in his hand and attempted to look in his mother’s mouth who was sitting next to him. </p>
<p>Tyler’s mother agreed to bring him back tomorrow and try again.  </p>
<p>Watch this video to learn more about the importance of a pre-visit.</p>
