<div class="pageblock"><p>You will start out this activity having recently completed one year of a general practice residency program. You have always planned to return to your hometown to practice since the start of your dental education. As discussed in high school, your dentist and longtime mentor Dr. Smith offers you an associateship leading to partnership in her office upon graduation. </p>
<p>After working at Dr. Smith’s practice for several months, she reveals to you that she has a 19 year old nephew Tyler, who was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at 18 months old. Her sister Donna, along with her son Tyler, recently moved back to their hometown and are seeking new providers for all of Tyler’s health care issues. Donna would like Dr. Smith to provide oral care for her son; however Dr. Smith did not receive training for working with patients with special needs when she attended dental school. Dr. Smith asks you if you received any training in treating persons with special needs and if you would be able to help her nephew.  </p>
<p>Fortunately, both your pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training offered some exposure to treating persons with special health care needs. This was usually done with a faculty member or attending in the hospital. You decide to schedule an appointment with Tyler because you would really like to help him and his family. You also want to make a good impression on your new boss and demonstrate your appreciation for her mentorship.</p>
<p>People with mild or moderate developmental disabilities often require a special approach to dental care. With some adaptation of the skills dental professionals use every day, most people with special needs can be treated successfully in the general practice setting. Throughout this activity, you will be challenged with access and treatment options of the special needs population. </p>
