<form method="post" action="."><div class="pageblock"><p>Nearly 48 million adults, or about 15.5% of the United States population, live in a rural location. But what is rural America? Is it a farming community in the heartland or the river-navigable region of the Mississippi Delta? Is it the Blackfeet Nation on the border of Canada or a predominantly Latino exurb in the southwest? How about a retirement community in New England or the ski-lover’s paradise of the Colorado Rockies? And why is the rural adult population a vulnerable population, in terms of oral health?</p>
<p>A vast space that encompasses over 75% of the country’s mass, rural land and life in the United States are as diverse geographically as they are culturally. Yet, there are some traits that characterize the rural adult population, at the population level. For example, rural adults tend to have poorer health than urban adults. This may be due to fewer medical and dental providers, higher rates of behavioral risk factors such as smoking tobacco or sedentariness, or a higher likelihood of being employed by a smaller firm that doesn’t provide benefits such as medical or dental insurance. However, there are some semi-rural communities that are doing well and even outperforming both their suburban and remote rural neighbors by many socioeconomic and health measures.</p>
