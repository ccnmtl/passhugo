<h3>Background: Your role</h3><div class="pageblock">
<p>You are the Springdale County Chair to the North Oralington State Dental Association (NOSDA).</p>
<p>You've been impressed by the different ways dentists have improved oral health care opportunities for rural adults in other parts of the country and youâ€™d like to draw on their experiences to do the same for Springdale County.</p>
<p>You have been notified that NOSDA was awarded a two-year $450,000 grant from a private non-profit institution with the specific goal of improving oral health and access to dental services for rural low income adults. NOSDA leadership has approached you as they are interested in executing the grant within Springdale County.</p>
{{< figure src="/img/assets/northoralington.jpg" alt="" class="right" >}}</div><h3>Grant details:</h3><div class="pageblock"><p>NOSDA wants to establish an oral health program that targets poor and low income rural adults.</p>
<strong>This program is expected to:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Improve oral health and/or access to dental services</li>
<li>Improve the quality of oral health care and/or patient satisfaction </li>
<li>Lowers the overall cost of oral health care</li>
</ol>
<strong>Additionally, this program must demonstrate high:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Impact (the program makes a significant difference in the oral health of the targeted population)</li>
<li>Cost-effectiveness (the program must give a good "bang for the buck")</li>
<li>Sustainability (the program can succeed past the two years of identified funding)</li>
</ol>
<p>NOSDA leadership is considering six proposals to accomplish this. You have been approached for your specific recommendation as to which single proposal is best suited for Springdale county.</p>
</div><h3>Your charge:</h3><div class="pageblock"><p><strong>1. Review the proposals and the map.</strong> <br/>
Review each of the six proposals NOSDA is considering. Each proposal is based on one strategy that has been successful elsewhere at a similar cost and scale.</p>
<p>Make sure you choose "Map Layers" to turn on and off data on the map while you read the proposals.</p>
<p><strong>2. Select a proposal.</strong><br/>
Select the proposal that will be most successful for improving oral health and access to dental care for poor/low-income rural adults (18-65y/o) in Springdale County.</p>
<p><strong>3. Defend the proposal.</strong><br/>
Defend your selected proposal before NOSDA leadership and answer questions about how and why you made your selection.</p><br/>
<p>Let's begin by reviewing the strategies...</p>
